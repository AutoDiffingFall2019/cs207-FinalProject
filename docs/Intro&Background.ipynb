    "Differentiation has ubiquitous applications in many areas of mathematics, sciences and engineering. As such, it is certainly useful and convenient if computer programs could carry out differentiation automatically for application in a wide variety of cases. For computationally heavy projects, the ability to compute derivatives automatically becomes even more critical as manually working out derivatives in such projects is certainly an impossible task. Even though there exists methods such as *numerical differentiation* and *symbolic differentiation* in determining derivatives computationally, these two methods have their limitations. In the following, we shall briefly review *numerical diffentiation* and *symbolic differentiation* to highlight some of their difficulties before moving on to describing *automatic differentiation* and the advantages it brings over the other two methods.   \n",
    "\n",
    "### Numerical Differentiation\n",
    "In *numerical differentiation*, the value of derivatives is approximated using the following formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\frac{\\partial{f(x)}}{\\partial{x}} \\approx \\frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "However, when the h values are too small, the numerical approximation fluctuates about the analytical answer. This is because the step size is too small, leading to a round-off error of the floating points caused by the limited precision of computations. On the other hand, when the h values are too large, the numerical approximation becomes inaccurate. This is because the step size is too big, leading to an error of approximation known as truncation error.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Symbolic Differentiation\n",
    "In *symbolic differentiation*, expressions are manipulated automatically to obtain the required derivatives. At its heart, *symbolic differentiation* applies transformations that captures the various rules of differentiation in order to manipulate the expressions. However, *symbolic differentiation* requires careful and sometimes ingenious design as accidental manipulation can easily produce large expressions which take up a lot of computational power and time, which leads to a problem known as expression swell.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Automatic Differentiation\n",
    "As seen from above, both *numerical differentiation* and *symbolic differentiation* have their respective issues when it comes to computing derivatives. These issues are further exacerbated when calculating higher order derivatives, where both errors and complexity increases. *Automatic differentiation* overcomes these issues by recognizing that every differentiation, no matter how complicated, can be executed in a stepwise fashion with each step being an execution of either the elementary arithmetic operations (addition, substraction, multiplication, division) or the elementary functions (sin, sqrt, exp, log, etc.). To track the evaluation of each step, *automatic differentiation* produces computational graphs and evaluation traces. To compute the derivatives, *automatic differentiation* applies the chain rule repeatedly at all steps. By taking a stepwise approach and using the chain rule, *automatic differentiation* circumvents the issues encountered by both *numerical differentiation* and *symbolic differentiation* and automatically compute derivatives that are both accurate and with a high level of precision. In order to further understand *automatic differentiation*, we present the mathematical background and essential ideas of *automatic differentiation* in the next section.\n",

    "# Background\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned before, *automatic differentiation* employs a stepwise approach and chain rule to automatically compute derivatives. We shall first state the chain rule in calculus before showing an example production of an evaluation trace and computational graph. Next, we discuss the two modes of *automatic differentiation*, namely the forward mode and reverse mode. In particular, we demonstrate the use of chain rule at each step to determine derivatives. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Chain Rule \n",
    "For a function $f(u(t),v(t))$, the chain rule is given by\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    " \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial t} = \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial u}\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} + \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial v}\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial t}\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The chain rule is essential for automatic differentiation as the forward mode applies the chain rule repeatedly at each step of the evaluation trace in order to determine the derivatives at each step (see below).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Production of Evaluation Trace & Computational Graph\n",
    "The most straightforward way to show the generation of an evaluation trace and computational graph is to consider an example. For this purpose, we study the following function \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "f(x,y) = sin(x) + 4y\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Evaluation Trace\n",
    "The evaluation trace breaks the function into individual steps and creates a buildup of the function starting with the input variables. At each step, only either an elementary arithmetic operation (addition, substraction, multiplication, division) or an elementary function (sin, sqrt, exp, log, etc.) is used to build the function for the next step. The evaluation trace for our function of interest is shown in the table below.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Computational Graph \n",
    "The computational graph translates the essence of the evaluation trace into a graph and captures the relationship between each step. Refer to the figure below for the computational graph of our function of interest.  \n",

    "Armed with the knowledge of the chain rule, evaluation trace and computational graph, we can now consider the forward mode of *automatic differentiation*. The table below shows the earlier evaluation trace table that has now been expanded to include columns that store derivatives. At each step, the chain rule is applied to the elementary function to determine the elementary function derivative.\n",

    "\n",
    "In addition, the first and second row has initial values for $\\nabla_{x}$ and $\\nabla_{y}$ as (1,0) and (0,1) respectively. These are actually seed values for the stepwise propagation of the values of derivatives. The forward mode actually calculates the dot product between the gradient of our function with the seed vector (ie directional derivative). In this case, we have a scalar function with two variables, but in the case of a vector function of vectors, the forward mode actually calculates the dot product between the Jacobian matrix ($J$) and seed vector ($p$) (ie $J.p$). \n",

    "\n",
    "In our *automatic differentiation* package, we can define a dual class that has two attributes. One of these attributes stores the value of the function while the other stores the value of the derivatives. This is similar to having a dual number with the value of a function as the real part and the value of derivatives as the dual part. Having such a dual number structure allows us to carry out the expected arithmetic operations between two dual instances.\n",
