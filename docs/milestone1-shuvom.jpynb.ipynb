    "The DualNumber() superclass will make up the core of our setup. The user may interact with the class to set up scalar- or vector-valued variables that will later be inputed into functions.  When constructing a DualNumber object, the user should _always_ specify a value and variable name (as a string) for the object as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. x = DualNumber(5, 'x')\n",
    "\n",
    "DualNumber will then store the variable name, 'x', and its value, 5 in the DualNumber data structure.  DualNumber will also be used to overload basic operations such as adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing.  \n",
    "\n",
    "To demonstrate the functionality of this class, let's focus on the overloaded \\_\\_add__ operator. Note that there are two regimes we should consider: (1) the case in which both the operands are the same variable (scalar-valued), (2) the case in which the operands are different variables.  The first case is relatively straightforward and we simply handle it by adding the derivatives and the values.  So, if the function is $f(x) = x^2 + \\sin(x)$ evaluated at $x=5$, we just add the two functions' values $5^2 + \\sin(5)$ and their derivatives. Here, it would look as follows:\n",
    "1. x = DualNumber(5, 'x')\n",
    "2. f = ElemFunctions.pow(x, 2) + ElemFunctions.sin(x)\n",
    "3. print(f.val, f.der)\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case where we have a vector-valued input, we create a dictionary to store the gradient (i.e. store the partials).  So, if we have $f(x,y) = x + y$, we'd have a gradient dictionary with the form $\\{'x': 1, 'y': 1\\}$.  To extract a specific partial derivative, the user can input f.get\\_der('x').\n",
    "\n",
    "The principles guiding this software design are grounded in its simplicity and robustness.  \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Each object in our automatic differentiation scheme will inherit from DualNumber() (for example, ElemFunctions(), explained below, is just an extension of DualNumber()) since all objects will have a value and gradient. \n",
    "2. Using the dictionary datatype to keep track of partial derivatives will allow the user clarity in specifying which variables to differentiate.  Theoretically, we could base this entire process in numpy arrays (and may do so in the future), but for an initial and clear implementation, having a dictionary helps us keep track of all the derivatives at once.\n",
    "3. Overriding each of the methods will allow fast and easy computation of the derivatives and their values.  Storing the variable names in the dictionary will also allow us to simultaneously keep track of all partials.\n",
    "\n",
    "Last, we have an argument _direction_ to the get\\_gradient method, which can be used to extract a directional derivative.  While this is not fully implemented in our pseudocode (as it is merely pseudocode), the user could extract a directional derivative by specifying f.get_der(direction={'x': 1, 'y': 3}).\n",
    "\n",
    "In the future, we wish to have an option for users to input the value later, during the calculation of the derivative (as opposed to first specifying the value), and we talked to Daniel at OH about this idea, but for now, we keep the implementation relatively simple to ensure our code is up and running.\n",
