For example, the team is considering collapsing both `scalar_func` and `vector_func` into a single `func` class so that the user only have to call upon one class when defining functions. In addition, we have to think of a way to tackle the case when users decide to create a function using `DualNumber` directly (ie not using our classes for functions). In that case, perhaps we should make `DualNumber` a private class and let users use `func` directly to create variables (ie treat variables as a scalar function of scalar input). "

The result of a reverse mode is only determined after the reverse pass is done, and the value of each variable or parent node at each stage depends on the values of its children nodes. As such, this has three important implications for the design of our package for reverse mode. \n",

Since the result cannot be calculated until the reverse pass is done and the variables at each stage of the reverse mode depends on the values of its children, we need to instantiate a reverse mode object/variable with an empty list that will temporarily hold the partial derivative values of its children during the forward pass. Note that we need a list here because it is possible for a parent node to have more than one child node."
